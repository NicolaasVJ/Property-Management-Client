# Property-Management-Client

The KKMND Property Management System has been developed to give the users a 
focused environment on thin clients. Users can Add, Edit and Remove records for 
Properties, Property types, Property Owners and Clients from the organisational 
database. Users can also make use of the loan calculator, the client program sends data 
to the server and then the server responds with the calculated values back to the client

# Client-side setup instructions
Step 1: Open the calcConfig.txt file contained in the PropertyManagementClient folder 
and edit it as desired. It should only have the ip and port number.The ip should point to 
the server ip and the port should match that of the server as displayed when https://github.com/NicolaasVJ/Property-Management-Server is run.

Step 2: Run the PropertManagement_KKMND.jar file to start the program.
